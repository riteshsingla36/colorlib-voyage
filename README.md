# Colorlib Voyage

Colorlib Voyage is a booking platform helping customers to do booking in their favourite Hotels & Resorts for free and help them to get great discounts. To build this clone we have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript along with amazing Teammates. This was our first collaborative Project at MASAI, to which we're grateful for.

## End Notes

In this project, we tried to achieve near to perfect clone. This entire journey of this construct week has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. Most of the features are added and the functionality of the website is achieved.
